There are three sets of work:

1. Apply DEIM on the Wave elevation. Sample out the DEIM control point (Results in 4.a).LSTM application between the box motion and DEIM control points.
2. Arbitrary Wavemaker excitation with TCOMS experimental Data. (Results 4.b)
3. Arbitrary Wavemaker excitation with TCOMS experimental Data with modification of the learning rate (Results 4.b).
4. LSTM-PINN (Results 4.c)
